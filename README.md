# Autonomous Robot Control Using GMapping And Navigation On ROS

Environment Mapping and Navigation is a technique to move an autonomous robot in an unknown environment. So here we are going to build a mapping and Navigation system for the autonomous robot. The whole project is developed with the ROS framework on ROS melodic as a distribution. The final robot is tested on the Gazebo simulator and visualized in rviz.

Build a robot application that communicates with the robot so that the control of the robot will be done using robot application. Here we are going to use a Gmapping package for SLAM technique in the Gazebo and Rviz. The static environment map will be created with the Laser distance sensor input from  the simulated environment. Build a Simulation application that communicates with the Robot application, Gazebo simulator, and Rviz. Develop a simulation robot using URDF and Xacro modeling techniques, that modeled robot will load inside the Gazebo simulator. The Gazebo world will be created with SDF techniques in the ROS.

With the help of Gazebo plugins. We will control the robot and also we will get the Laser Distance Sensor data So that the robot will use SLAM on the Gazebo simulation environment. Test the Gmapping algorithm with SLAM by using an autonomous robot, control the Robot inside the mapped environment.
